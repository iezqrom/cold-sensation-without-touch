This code was written at the beginning of my PhD. The quality of the code is very low. Standard coding practices to maximise readibility and compatibility were not followed. Still, the code should run straight away if the Python version and the Python packages are the ones indicated below, the paths and folder structure are set correctly and the data is downloaded and uncompressed. This code is published for transparency and archival purposes. If you want to use any of the Python code in this repository, I encourage you to contact me first at [ivan.ezquerra.romano@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:ivan.ezquerra.romano@ucl.ac.uk).

Some functions and classes imported in the Python code here can be found in the following [repository](https://github.com/iezqrom/ier-phd-tools).
